//start the game, let the computer choose the word 




    //loop over the pre-determined word choices

    //first word selected
    //populate the blank spaces according to the length of the selected word, and render
    //that many blank spaces
    //have a count of total guesses of each word  before failure, which is the length 
    //of each word +5
    //use a  click event to listen for the keystroke
    //if a correct key is struck, populate blank value with the correct key
    //if an incorrect key is struck, add it to a list of incorrect keys, and stop 
    //listening or using that key
    //if word is completed before the user runs out of guesses, they win.
    //if user wins, image populates left section, as well as meme info, link, and music
    //if user doesnt win, populate left side with  mario over spikes
    //record number of wins a losses
    //if number of wins hits 5, tell them they are meme gods.
    //if number of wins is over 30 and their win/loss ratio is above 80%, show special 
    //meme and music



    // If there are no more questions, stop the function.
  
    // Determine which key was pressed, make it lowercase, and set it to the userInput variable.

    //this should be an entire code block for each word
    // Only run this code if "t" or "f" were pressed.
  

        // If they guess the correct answer, increase and update score, alert them they got it right.
  
        // If wrong, alert them they are wrong.
